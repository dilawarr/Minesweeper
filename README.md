# Minesweeper-

GUI-based Minesweeper variation coded on C++ for university semester project for the course of Object Oriented Programming. 

GUI made using SFML 2.0 libraries and spritepng of the original game.
Basic main menu edited using MS-Paint.

Consists of three difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard
Each level consisting of increased rows, columns and mines.

Code probably isnt the most efficient, but it works as intended. No bugs and no memory leaks.
